For anyone who wants to contribute, I need your help in two things:

1. Since the camera is reading the gestures live, so there is an issue when more than 1 fingers are shown as reading done say for 3 fingues, in order of 1 then 2 and then finally 3. Hence giving 3 different outputs instead of single output.
2. Is there a way i can communicate with arduino from python code? If yes, then please put a transmitting of data in each gesture reading case
